## The endpoint

`src/app/api/graphql/route.ts` mounts GraphQL Yoga as a Next.js route handler,
answering `GET` and `POST` at `/api/graphql`. It runs in the app's own process:
no separate service, no second deploy, no extra hosting cost.

- **The proxy does not guard it.** `src/proxy.ts`'s matcher skips `/api/*`, so a
  signed-out request reaches Yoga rather than being redirected to `/sign-in`.
  The endpoint has to refuse in its own error shape, since a fetch cannot follow
  a redirect to a page. A signed-out request reaches the schema with a `null`
  session (["The request context"](request-context.md)), and a scope or a
  service refuses it there.
- **The handler takes the request only.** Next also passes a route context,
  `{ params }`, and this route has no params. So Yoga gets an empty server
  context instead of a Next type it has no field in common with, and the
  request context is built from Yoga's own `request`.
